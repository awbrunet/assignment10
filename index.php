<h3>What is myGlutenFree?</h3>
<br>
<p style = 'width: 70%; margin: auto; text-align: justify;'>In recent years, there's been a new 'trend'; a fad diet called 'gluten-free'. Many gluten-free eaters don't even know what gluten <i>is</i>.
<br><br>
Gluten is a protein composite found in modern wheat, a foodstuff that forms the backbone of many humans' diets 
(don't believe me? check out <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gluten#Uses">Wikipedia</a>). Many individuals are discovering that they are
being diagnosed with a previously-unheard-of disease: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coeliac_disease">Celiac's</a>. While not everyone sensitive to gluten
has Celiac's, allergic reactions to food are never fun - and in many cases, they can be downright life-threatening. 
<br><br>
While the advent of the gluten-free fad diet has led to a rise in interest, bringing about many new gluten-free food products, many restaurants are still
behind the curve. Anyone who has Celiac's or another gluten sensitivity, or has a loved one with a sensitivity, will know how frustrating and difficult 
it can be to find a place to eat that's safe.

<br>
<h3>Get to the point!</h3>

<p style = 'width: 70%; margin: auto; text-align: justify;'>
My hope is that myGlutenFree Burlington acts as a service to make life easier for people affected by Celiac's and related gluten sensitivities. 
<br><br>
While other sites exist that collect gluten free restaurants, I wanted to make a site specific for the greater Burlington area for residents to upload
 restaurants where they had a gluten-friendly experience.

<h3>So what can I do with this?</h3>
<p style = 'width: 70%; margin: auto; text-align: justify;'>
Think of myGlutenFree Burlington as a tool to build your own newsletter. When you register your email, 
users can submit restaurants where they had a positive experience. All users can then save these restaurants for later
 viewing; for instance, the next time you're planning to go out on the town. When submitting or saving a new
restaurant, you'll receive an email with the restaurant's information inside!
<br>Restaurants can be saved and unsaved as many times as you want; you'll receive a new email each time.

<br><br>
Eat Safe!
